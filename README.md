Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Installation and Deployment 
Nessus is a widely used vulnerability scanning tool and security platform developed by Tenable Network Security. It is designed to help organizations identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other security issues in their computer systems, network devices, and applications.

Nessus performs comprehensive security assessments by scanning target systems and analyzing their configurations, services, and applications. It employs a vast database of known vulnerabilities and utilizes various techniques to identify potential security risks, such as outdated software versions, weak passwords, and insecure network configurations. The tool can scan both internal and external network resources and supports a wide range of operating systems, network devices, and applications.

Once the scanning process is complete, Nessus generates detailed reports that provide information about the identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommendations for remediation. These reports help security professionals and system administrators prioritize and address the vulnerabilities to strengthen the security posture of their systems.

1. Set up your Azure Virtual Machine -OS:  Windows 10 (VM1)

Azure is a cloud computing platform and service offered by Microsoft. It provides a wide range of cloud services that enable organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.

A virtual machine (VM) on Microsoft Azure is a computing resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. Each VM instance can run its own operating system (OS), which means multiple VMs can run different operating systems on the same physical machine.

Create a new Azure resource group, virtual network, subnet and virtual machine running Windows 10. Choose a VM size according to your needs. Once the VM1 is set up, you will need to connect to it using Remote Desktop. For this, you'll need the public IP address of the VM and the credentials you provided during the VM setup.

2. Set up 2nd Azure Virtual Machine - OS: Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS - x64 Gen2 aka Linux (VM2)

Create a new Azure resource group, virtual network, subnet and virtual machine running Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS - x64 Gen2 also known as Linux . Choose a VM size according to your needs. Once the VM2 is set up, you will need to connect to it using Remote Desktop. For this, you'll need the public IP address of the VM and the credentials you provided during the VM setup.
